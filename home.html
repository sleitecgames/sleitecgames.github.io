            <b>9/05/2019</b> 2019 Rewind & 2020
		</header>
        
        <article class="tab">
		<br>Well 2019 was somewhat an experience but honestly, it feels like nothing really happened.
		<br>Compared to 2018, except for some motocycle rides, and motocross sessions I didn't really
		<br>do much besides working at home and at my full time job. Even though I struggle a lot
		<br>with focusing on my private project, it is always on my mind, every day, 24/7.
		<br>I made an soft release for android & ios, added every feature I wanted to have in
		<br>for my next mobile games and experienced other issues with releasing and & marketing 
		<br>games. Unfortunately on the cost of programming, especially for core C++ stuff.
		<br>At my full time job where we mainly work on World of Tanks, python is the main language for 
		<br>Gameplay and besides some prototype games in UE4 nothing really was going on at the moment.
		<br>As mentioned at home I'm also mainly focusing on high level gameplay stuff and platform code.
		<br>So there is currently a lack of low level core technology programming in my life ._. .
		<br>But we'll see, maybe my next private game will bringt more interesting stuff.

            <b>9/05/2019</b> Update
		</header>
        
        <article class="tab">
		<br> 2018 was a disaster in terms of game development. I quit my Job to come to Austria for my project
		<br> and ended up doing nearly nothing. Development struggled everywhere, especially due to my non game related job
		<br> and friends & family who distrated me a lot.
		<br> Recently I got out of my non game job and had time to focus on my project again. But development was still 
		<br> extremly slow. Seems like its a personal thing and I still need to find some management in order to be able to
		<br> focus on my own stuff. I have 1 more month left until I start in a games job again, but I will continue fully
		<br> on my own project, probably push even more hours. The android softlaunch is close,
		<br> and I'll probably start another project 1 month after the full release.
		<br> Additionally I'm relocating again for my Job besides my own project, so I'm basically back in my home town were I have more space
		<br> and therefore I'll have my own office room for better development.
		<br> Respect to those who can work on projects without being distracted.

        <article class="tab">
		<br> I'm currently working on a game, actually already for a few months, but the progress is so slow.
		<br> The game is small, therefore should be already finished, but due to lack of motivation and discipline
		<br> nothing is working as planned. I'll try to focus my energy and work on my discipline again to get it done.

            <b>14/05/2018</b> Back in Austria - Not as expected
		</header>
        
        <article class="tab">
		<br> I'm now back in Austria for a little more than a month and relocated to Vienna, due to a new non gamedev job.
		<br> In this time I've noticed that I was kinda stupid enough to think that I'll be able to directly keep up my private workschedule 
		<br> which I had in UK, but there was too much distraction (friends, family, motocross and motocycles). 
		<br> In UK i were kinda forced to do something, while here I have so much distraction again.
		<br> My whole game dev and learning plan got delayed for at least 1 1/2 months, maybe even more since
		<br> it is kinda hard for me at the moment to gain back my discipline from UK. Hopefully everything works out.

            <b>23/03/2018</b> Leaving TT - My own company 
		</header>
        
        <article class="tab">
		<br> I'll be leaving TT, because I want to create my own games company. I've enjoyed my time here and learned new stuff,
		<br> but for a few months now I have this idea about trying to create my own games. Since I have lots of experience with mobile games
		<br> I'll start in this area first and try to get more crazy with my games over time. But I won't be working full time for my 
		<br> own company, I'll join a non gamedev company for 40h/week as normal software developer to catchup with non game related 
		<br> technologies since hard core game dev studios tend to stick to old technologies (including my self :P)

            <b>22/01/2018</b> GameTool - Open Source Project
		</header>
        
        <article class="tab">
             I had this idea for a long time, and just started this non coding intensive project,
             because it's kinda usefull for myself.
             <br><br>Since I came here to UK, i kinda realized that my PC isn't the best anymore, 
             and it often was running on it's MAX and needed to check 
             running Applications when playing games or compiling,
             otherwise I'd have a worse experience when working with the PC.
             Task Manager helps but it has too much unecessary info and it's not handy when playing games. Therefore I've started this Tool project
             which will stick in front of all applications, small(like NVIDIAS show FPS), customizable(in the future). At the momen CPU and RAM works perfectly
             and it's running in the background all the time.

		</header>
        
        <article class="tab">
            <br> I'm working professionally in the games industry for little more than 3 years now but
			<br> today my first AAA game got release where I was working as part of the Tools Programming Team.
			<br> I have to admit, I love the Marvel story and watched all Marvel movies multiple times, therefore 
			<br> it is amazing to be a part of a marvel game :)
			<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ud1g5JdGdM"> Youtube Link </a> Check out the amazing Thor Ragnarok inspired trailer, it's awesome!
