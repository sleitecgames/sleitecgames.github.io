				<h1>Dominik Reisner</h1>

				<br>
				<br> I'm Dominik, a 25 years old video game developer and c++ enthusiast from Austria.. 
                <br> Currently working on my own mobile game projects and also working as game developer for Bongfish.
			
				<br> Recently I've relocated back from UK to austria mainly to start working on my own game projects, since 
				<br> working on private projects wasn't allowed at Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment.
				<br> Additonally I wanted to make it as easy as possible for me to created games (taxes, legally selling stuff) 
				<br> and also getting a little bit more serious about creating stuff, therefore Austria was the obvious 
				<br> since I know most of the stuff, and also know people here who have their own companies.
				
		        <br> Generally, I'm professionally working in the games industry for over 5 years now and a little more in overall software development with C/C++.
                <br> My interests and hobbies are playing video games, games development, low latency high performance programming and also motocross/motocycles.
				<br> Beside programming I'm also a passionate gamer and at the moment my favorite game is WoW,Dota2 and PUBG.
                <br> But the best game for me will always be Guild Wars(1).
				<br>
				<br> Privately I'm more working on gameplay/mechanics Programming stuff or general c++ stuff, where I'm constantly
				<br> trying to expand my knowledge in this area and also general software development.
				<br> For dedicated work I'm more interested in low level high performance c++ programming, therefore I'm
				<br> really interested in game engine / systems /framework programming where this level of performance and
				<br> knowledge is necessary.
                <br>
